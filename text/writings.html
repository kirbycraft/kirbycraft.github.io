    Kirby's Generalized Philosophy of Writing Songs
    </h1>
<p>Below are listed some random thoughts on how and why I write songs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Songs are like lifes and life does not fade out, so neither should songs. Sometimes you'll want a song to 'go on forever' but that's folly.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lyrics should not be embarrassing to speak out loud, if they make you embarrassed you need to figure out why and either try again or convince yourself you're over-analyzing.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melody is important.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Listen to good songs and then learn the best parts to use in your own songs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Music is of a dual nature; it is easy to write and impossible to write. If you ever write a song you'll know what I mean.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Music is inherent to humans and animals- do not believe people who claim they do not like listening to music.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When poptimists gush on and on about production and how 'clean' a song sounds it makes me imagine a little kid waking up on Christmas morning and running downstairs and jumping up and down yelling about how pretty the wrapping paper is and how they have beautiful bows and ribbons and perfectly side-chained drums with incredible saturation plug-ins while completly ignoring the present- aka the song itself. <br><br><em>If you can hear the most important parts of your song across different speakers that's all that matters.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li>Finally- play an instrument every day, even if you don't feel like it.</li>
    </ul>

            Some of my Favorite Video Games
        </h1>
            <p>
            I used to play games as a kid because they were fun, specifically because you could do things in the game you weren't allowed or able to do easily in real life, like fight people, fly, etc. but the older I get the more interested I am in ways video games and my life overlap. I also think video games are unique in that their storytelling can be interactive and able to express ideas and themes difficult to express in other mediums.
            <br>
            <br>
            The games that I've enjoyed the most are from <em>the Dragon Quest series, the YS series, the Final Fantasy series</em> and other games like <em>Lufia 2, Xenogears, Terranigma, Tales of Phantasia and Tales of Graces f (most Tales of games actually), and Breath of Fire 3 and 5.</em> I also like <em>Starfox 64</em>, pretty much every <em>Zelda game, Kingdom Hearts 1, and Grandia 1.</em> 
            <br>
            <br>
            All of the games I've mentioned have really good soundtracks and are generally worth playing (you'll have to emulate some of them but it's worth it), they aren't necessarily easy especially if you're new to video games, but overall I'd just like to recommend these games and game series if you're interested in interactive storytelling or good music and art.
