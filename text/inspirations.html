    <h1>
    IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
        </h1>
        <h2> 1. The Beach Boys
        </h2>
        <p> My favorite band of all time. The songs, the lore, straddling the border between Spirituality and Silliness- the perfect band.
            </p>
        <h3> 2. Mystical Ninja: Starring Goemon
        </h3>
        <p> This is my favorite video game and favorite soundtrack. Some of the first music I remember standing out to me as a kid.
        </p>
         <h3> 3. Maplestory OST (pre-big bang)
        </h3>
        <p> The music in this game is very nostalgic to me, I especially love 'Fantasia'.
        </p>
         <h3> 4. The Beatles
        </h3>
        <p> Should be obvious. I love their early power-pop songs the most.
        </p>
        <h3> 5. Daniel Johnston
        </h3>
        <p> Daniel Johnston's lyrics and recording quality are interesting.
        </p>
            <h3> 6. Nick Drake
        </h3>
        <p> Made me want to 'get good' at acoustic guitar.
        </p>
        <h3> 7. Jeff Buckley
        </h3>
        <p> His guitar-playing stood out to me and made me want to learn chords other than cowboy chords.
        </p>
        <h3> 8. Bossa Nova
        </h3>
        <p> 
            Dorival Caymmi, Joao Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim are my favorites.
        </p>
        <h3> 9. Elliott Smith
        </h3>
        <p> His songs are beautiful (and full of major 2 chords).
        </p>
        <h3> 10. Tie between Minutemen and The Ramones first 3 albums
        </h3>
        <p> The length of their songs made me want to write short songs.
        </p>
        <h3>Other bands worth mentioning:
              </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Luminous Orange</b>- this band has 2 phenomenal albums in the pop/shoegaze genre, 'Songs of Innocence' and 'Drop You Vivid Colors'. Check out the songs 'Violet', 'I Saw No More' and 'Give a Hint'. They need to put their song 'Riverboat' online though cause it's their best.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MBV</b>- I like their 1st album and s/t album a lot, 'loveless' is alright but I wouldn't say I was inspired by it as much as their EPs or other albums. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sweet Trip</b>- Lotsa good songs with strong melodies.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <b>The Replacements</b>- Lots of strong songs with good melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Bradford Cox</b>- Atlas Sound and Deerhunter are very cool, I love their music and I found out about Stereolab from them. I think Moses Archuleta is one of the best modern drummers. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Robin Pecknold</b>- I really like his melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Mew</b>- Last mention for inspirations, Mew's albums up until 'No More Stories' are incredible and their debut album 'A Triumph for Man' is very underrated. I miss Bo.
