        <h3>
            Who are you?
        </h3>
        <p>
            My name is Kirby Craft- I'm from Georgia and enjoy writing melodic songs in the classic singer-songwriter vein. I mainly play guitar, piano and am currently learning bass.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Why 'Diamond Spine'?
        </h3>
        
        <p> 1) It's a reminder to have a backbone- not letting fear stop you from doing what you want is easier said than done, but doing something hard starts with doing something simple.
        </p>
        <p> 2) You could also consider it the binding to my 'Big Book o'Songs'
        </p>
        <p>
            3) It's fun to say 'Diamond Spine dot Online because it kind of rhymes' :)
        </p>
        
         <h3>
            Can I use your song(s) in my video/cover etc.?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            All of my songs are in the public domain. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Are your songs on [this streaming service]?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        I'm working to make sure my songs are on all relevant sites, I will upload everything <a href="/music/music" title=diamondspine.online/music>here</a> first though.
        </p>  
        
        <h3> How do I know you've released new music or a new blogpost?
        </h3>
        
        <p>There won't be any announcements, it'll be a surprise to everyone, just check in every now and then and there will hopefully be new stuff.</p>
        
        <h3>
        Are you on Social Media?
        </h3>
        
        <p>Not really, there are probably accounts I made in the past but they are inactive- I do not plan on creating accounts for my music or to express my views. </p>
