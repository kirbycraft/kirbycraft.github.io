            FAQ

        <h3>
            Who are you?
        </h3>
        <p>
            My name is Kirby Craft- I'm from Georgia and enjoy writing melodic songs in the classic singer-songwriter vein. I mainly play guitar, piano and am currently learning bass.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Why 'Diamond Spine'?
        </h3>
        
        <p> 1) It's a reminder to have a backbone- not letting fear stop you from doing what you want is easier said than done, but doing something hard starts with doing something simple.
        </p>
        <p> 2) You could also consider it the binding to my 'Big Book o'Songs'
        </p>
        <p>
            3) It's fun to say 'Diamond Spine dot Online because it kind of rhymes' :)
        </p>
        
         <h3>
            Can I use your song(s) in my video/cover etc.?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            All of my songs are in the public domain, you can do whatever you want with them! The concept of 'intellectual property' is silly and a cancer to creativity. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Are your songs on [this streaming service]?
        </h3>
        <p>
        I'm working to make sure my songs are on all relevant sites, I will upload everything here first though.
        </p>         
        <h3>
        Are you on Social Media?
        </h3>
        <p>Not really, I had a facebook to follow room-mate/apartment ads a while ago but I am never on it.</p>
